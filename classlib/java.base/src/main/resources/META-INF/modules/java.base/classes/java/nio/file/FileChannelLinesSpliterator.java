/**
 * A file-based lines spliterator, leveraging a shared mapped byte buffer and
 * associated file channel, covering lines of a file for character encodings
 * where line feed characters can be easily identified from character encoded
 * bytes.
 *
 * <p>
 * When the root spliterator is first split a mapped byte buffer will be created
 * over the file for it's size that was observed when the stream was created.
 * Thus a mapped byte buffer is only required for parallel stream execution.
 * Sub-spliterators will share that mapped byte buffer.  Splitting will use the
 * mapped byte buffer to find the closest line feed characters(s) to the left or
 * right of the mid-point of covered range of bytes of the file.  If a line feed
 * is found then the spliterator is split with returned spliterator containing
 * the identified line feed characters(s) at the end of it's covered range of
 * bytes.
 *
 * <p>
 * Traversing will create a buffered reader, derived from the file channel, for
 * the range of bytes of the file.  The lines are then read from that buffered
 * reader.  Once traversing commences no further splitting can be performed and
 * the reference to the mapped byte buffer will be set to null.
